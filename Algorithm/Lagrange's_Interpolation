Objective: Program to implement Lagrange’s Interpolation 
Method. 
Algorithm: 
 1.Start 
 2. Read number of data (n) 
 3. Read data Xi and Yi for i=1 ton n 
 4. Read value of independent variables say xp 
 	whose corresponding value of dependent say yp is to be 
	determined. 
 
 5. Initialize: yp = 0 
 6. For i = 1 to n 
 	Set p = 1 
 	For j =1 to n 
 	If i ≠ j then 
 	Calculate p = p * (xp - Xj)/(Xi - Xj) 
 	End If 
 	Next j 
 	Calculate yp = yp + p * Yi 
 	Next i 
 7. Display value of yp as interpolated value. 
 8. Stop
