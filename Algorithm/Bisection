Objective: Program to Implement Bisection Method 
Algorithm: 
1. Start
2. Read x1, x2, e 
	*Here x1 and x2 are initial guesses 
	e is the absolute error i.e. the desired degree of accuracy*
3. Compute: f1 = f(x1) and f2 = f(x2)
4. If (f1*f2) > 0, then display initial guesses are wrong and goto 
   (11). 
   Otherwise continue.
5. x = (x1 + x2)/2
6. If ( [ (x1 â€“ x2)/x ] < e ), then display x and goto (11). 
	* Here [ ] refers to the modulus sign. *
7. Else, f = f(x)
8. If ((f*f1) > 0), then x1 = x and f1 = f.
9. Else, x2 = x and f2 = f.
10.Goto (5). 
	*Now the loop continues with new values.*
11.Stop
