Objective: Program to implement Newton Raphson Method. 
Algorithm: 
1. Start 
2. Read x, e, n, d 
	*x is the initial guess 
	e is the absolute error i.e the desired degree of accuracy 
	n is for operating loop 
	d is for checking slope* 
3. Do for i =1 to n in step of 2 
4. f = f(x) 
5. f1 = f'(x) 
6. If ( [f1] < d), then display too small slope and goto 11. 
	*[ ] is used as modulus sign* 
7. x1 = x – f/f1 
8. If ( [(x1 – x)/x1] < e ), the display the root as x1 and goto 11. 
	*[ ] is used as modulus sign* 
9. x = x1 and end loop 
10.Display method does not converge due to oscillation. 
11.Stop
