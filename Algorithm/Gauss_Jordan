Objective: Program to implement Gauss Jordan Method. 
Algorithm: 
1. Start 
2. Read the order of the matrix ‘n’ and read the coefficients of the 
linear equations. 
3. Do for k=1 to n 
	Do for l=k+1 to n+1 
	a[k][l] = a[k][l] / a[k][k] 
	End for l 
	Set a[k][k] = 1 
	Do for i=1 to n 
	if (i not equal to k) then, 
	Do for j=k+1 to n+1 
	a[i][j] = a[i][j] – (a[k][j] * a[i][k]) 
	End for j 
	End for i 
	End for k 
4. Do for m=1 to n 
	x[m] = a[m][n+1] 
	Display x[m] 
	End for m 
5. Stop
