# CBNST-Lab

## Lab-1
**Program 1** </br>Convert any matrix into 
* Upper Traingle
* Lower triangle</br>

[Here is the program](https://github.com/akshatprogrammer/CBNST-Lab/blob/main/UpperAndLowerTriangle.cpp)</br>

**Program 2** </br>To extract the coefficients and degrees of the variable in 2 diffrent arrays.

</br>[Here is the program](https://github.com/akshatprogrammer/CBNST-Lab/blob/main/DegreeAndCoeffecient.cpp)

## Lab-2

* B. Cos x
* C. Tan x
* D. Cot x
* E. Cosex x
* F. Sec x
* G. Log10 x
* H. Ln x
* I. Log2 x
* J. e^x

## Lab-3
**BISECTION METHOD**</br>
The bisection method is a root-finding method that applies to any continuous functions for which one knows two values with opposite signs.
</br>[Here are examples with output ss](https://github.com/akshatprogrammer/CBNST-Lab/tree/Bisection/Bisection)

## Lab-4
**REGULA FALSI METHOD**</br>
The Regula–Falsi Method is a numerical method for estimating the roots of a polynomial f(x). A value x replaces the midpoint in the Bisection Method and serves as the new approximation of a root of f(x). The objective is to make convergence faster. Assume that f(x) is continuous.

## Lab-5
**NEWTON RALPHSON METHOD**</br>
The Newton-Raphson method (also known as Newton's method) is a way to quickly find a good approximation for the root of a real-valued function f ( x ) = 0 f(x) = 0 f(x)=0. It uses the idea that a continuous and differentiable function can be approximated by a straight line tangent to it.

## Lab-6
**GAUSS ELIMINATION METHOD**</br>
The Gaussian elimination method is known as the row reduction algorithm for solving linear equations systems. It consists of a sequence of operations performed on the corresponding matrix of coefficients.
</br>[Here is example]()

## Lab-7
**GAUSS JORDAN METHOD**</br>
The Gauss-Jordan method is similar to the Gaussian elimination process, except that the entries both above and below each pivot are zeroed out.
</br>[Here is example]()

## Lab-8
**Newton's Forward INTERPOLATION METHOD**</br>
This formula is particularly useful for interpolating the values of f(x) near the beginning of the set of values given. h is called the interval of difference and u = ( x – a ) / h, Here a is the first term.</br>
