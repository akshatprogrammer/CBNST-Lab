## Lab-1
**Program 1** </br>Convert any matrix into 
* Upper Traingle
* Lower triangle</br>

[Here is the program](https://github.com/akshatprogrammer/CBNST-Lab/blob/main/UpperAndLowerTriangle.cpp)</br>

**Program 2** </br>To extract the coefficients and degrees of the variable in 2 diffrent arrays.

</br>[Here is the program](https://github.com/akshatprogrammer/CBNST-Lab/blob/main/DegreeAndCoeffecient.cpp)

## Lab-2
**Program 1**</br>Give the demonstrationof built-in C functions of following mathematical functions
* A. Sin x
* B. Cos x
* C. Tan x
* D. Cot x
* E. Cosex x
* F. Sec x
* G. Log10 x
* H. Ln x
* I. Log2 x
* J. e^x
</br>[Here is the program](https://github.com/akshatprogrammer/CBNST-Lab/blob/main/UseOfMathematicalFunctions.cpp)


## Lab-3
**BISECTION METHOD**</br>
The bisection method is a root-finding method that applies to any continuous functions for which one knows two values with opposite signs.
</br>[Here are examples with output ss](https://github.com/akshatprogrammer/CBNST-Lab/tree/Bisection/Bisection)

## Lab-4
**REGULA FALSI METHOD**</br>
The Regulaâ€“Falsi Method is a numerical method for estimating the roots of a polynomial f(x). A value x replaces the midpoint in the Bisection Method and serves as the new approximation of a root of f(x). The objective is to make convergence faster. Assume that f(x) is continuous.
